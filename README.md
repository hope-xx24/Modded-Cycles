## Why

The Model:Cycles is a great little groovebox, but its firmware leaves some obvious things on the table:
the USB output only carries the stereo mix, there are just six machines, the tempo stops at 300 BPM,
and a few everyday gestures (muting, removing trigs) take more presses than they should.

Modded Cycles patches **your own copy** of the official OS to fix that. You pick the mods you want,
the page builds the firmware in your browser, and sends it to the Model:Cycles over USB.
Going back to the official firmware is one click away.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Elektron firmware is included in this repository**, original or modified. You bring the official OS
> file from [elektron.se](https://www.elektron.se/support-downloads/modelcycles); the mods are applied to it on your computer.
> This is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Elektron. Flashing a modified OS is
> **at your own risk** and may void your warranty.

## The mods

| Mod | What you get | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **6-channel USB audio** | Each track gets its own USB channel (48 kHz / 32-bit): record six separate stems in your DAW. OS updates over USB keep working. | ✅ Tested |
| **Syntakt engines** | Up to five real Syntakt machines added next to the original six: **SD VINTAGE**, **CP VINTAGE**, **SY TOY**, **SY BITS** and **SY SWARM**, with the Syntakt's knob names and defaults. They are read from your own Syntakt OS file. | ✅ Tested |
| **Model-TG** | A full Sampler machine with seven playback modes, resampling, a beat-repeat page with master FX, slide trigs, Scale Lock and more, by [TinyGregAudio](https://github.com/TinyGregAudio/Model-TG). Works with the 6-channel mod and the Syntakt engines. | 🧪 Experimental |
| **MACRO machine** | One extra machine with the 47 synthesis models of Braids, Émilie Gillet's open-source macro-oscillator, from [her own code](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack): analog-style waves, FM, vowels, physical models, drums, wavetables and noises. `SHAPE` picks the model, `COLOR` and `SWEEP` shape it. Works with Model-TG, not with the Syntakt engines. | ✅ Tested |
| **Tape delay and Plate reverb** | Two more effect algorithms next to the original ones, chosen per pattern: hold the settings (cog) button and turn `DELAY SEND` for the delay, `REVERB SEND` for the reverb. *Tape* is a tape echo with wow, saturation and darker repeats; *Plate* is a fixed-point rewrite of the reverb of Émilie Gillet's modules. Needs Model-TG. Command line only for now (`build.py`), not in the web flasher. | 🧪 Experimental, never flashed |
| **Arpeggiator** | Hold several notes with RETRIG and they play as an arpeggio. `FUNC` + `RETRIG` adds direction (up, down, up/down, random, or in the order played) and range (1 to 4 octaves), saved with the pattern. | ✅ Tested |
| **Tempo up to 546 BPM** | The TEMPO knob, tap tempo, MIDI clock and saved projects go past 300 BPM. Tempo-synced LFOs stay in time. | ✅ Tested |
| **Startup animation** | When the Model:Cycles starts, the four squares of the modded-cycles logo pop in and “modded-cycles” types itself underneath, instead of the original tile animation. Same duration. | ✅ Tested |
| **Easier trig removal** | A quick press on a step that holds a trig removes it, instead of opening it as a hold. | ✅ Tested |
| **Latching mute** | Hold `TRACK` and tap `FUNC`: mute mode stays on, no more holding `FUNC`. By [drumkilla](https://github.com/drumkilla/elektron-model-tweaks). | ✅ Tested |
| **Trig preview** | Sequencer stopped or paused: hold a step and press `PAGE` to hear it, with its note, length and p-locks. By drumkilla. | ✅ Tested |
| **Scrolling names** | Sound names too long for the screen scroll in the sound browser. By drumkilla. | ✅ Tested |
| **Samples OS** | Turns the Model:Cycles into a Model:Samples, built from both official OS files. Coming back needs a MIDI interface. | ✅ Tested |
| **Cycles OS for Model:Samples** | The other way round: turns a Model:Samples into a Model:Cycles, over USB, from both official OS files. Going back to the Model:Samples OS works over USB too, from the same tab. | 🧪 Experimental |

The mods can be combined freely (Samples OS and Cycles OS for Model:Samples are separate installs; MACRO and the Syntakt engines not together). Each one is explained step by step, with the buttons to press, in the
**[guide](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/guide/)**.

## Install in four steps

<img src="docs/images/readme/flasher.png" alt="The web flasher, step 1: a list of mods with checkboxes, 6-channel USB audio ticked" width="100%">

1. **Open the [web flasher](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/flasher/)** in Chrome, Edge or Opera on a desktop computer (it needs Web MIDI).
2. **Tick the mods you want.**
3. **Drop your official OS file**, `model-cycles_OS1.13.syx`, from the [Elektron download](https://www.elektron.se/support-downloads/modelcycles) (unzip it first).
   For the Syntakt engines, also drop `Syntakt_OS1.42.syx` ([download](https://www.elektron.se/support-downloads/syntakt); 1.41 works too).
4. **Connect the Model:Cycles over USB and press Flash.** Close Elektron Transfer first and leave the machine on its usual screen.
   The transfer takes about 30 seconds, then the Model:Cycles asks you to confirm with **YES**.

Everything runs in your browser: your files are never uploaded anywhere.

**Before you flash**, back up your projects and samples with Elektron Transfer.

<details>
<summary><b>Other ways to flash</b></summary>

- **Classic method.** If the fast method does not work on your setup, the flasher can also send the firmware the
  way Elektron Transfer does through `CONFIG › UPGRADE` (5 to 10 minutes).
- **Elektron Transfer.** The flasher has a *Download the .syx* button: drop that file onto Elektron Transfer yourself.
- **Command line.** See [Command line](#command-line) below.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Going back to the official firmware</b></summary>

Open the flasher, choose the **Official firmware** tab, drop your official OS file and flash. Before that,
set any track that uses an added machine (Syntakt engine, MACRO or Sampler) back to one of the six original machines.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>If something goes wrong</b></summary>

If a Model:Cycles ever stops starting, it can always be recovered from its startup menu (`FUNC` + power on, then `TRIG 4`).
That menu only listens to the **MIDI IN** port, so you need a USB-MIDI interface and the scripts described in
[`FLASH.md`](FLASH.md) (in French). The guide has a [troubleshooting section](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/guide/#trouble).

</details>

## Command line

The web flasher is a port of a pure-Python toolchain that lives in this repository: no compiler and no firmware needed.

```sh
python3 tools/build.py --list                       # every available mod
python3 tools/build.py -i model-cycles_OS1.13.syx -t 6ch-usbup,latching-mute,trig-preview,browser-scroll
./flash.sh                                           # macOS / Linux  (flash.bat on Windows)
```

Details in [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) and [`FLASH.md`](FLASH.md) (both in French). The web flasher is checked byte for byte
against the Python build (`tools/webflash_check.sh`, `tools/webbuild_check.sh`).

## How it is made

Every mod is checked in an emulator that runs the Model:Cycles' own code, and then on a real Model:Cycles before it is
marked *Tested*. The Syntakt engines are not imitations: their code and tables are taken from your Syntakt OS file and
relocated into the Model:Cycles firmware, and they produce the same samples as the Syntakt in emulation.

The research behind it (firmware analysis, hardware architecture, engine ports, measurements) is written up in the
[technical notes](notes/README.md), in French. Release notes for each flasher version are on the
[website](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/#version).
